## philosophy

We grew up on the web; it's nostalgic. We've also seen how it's changed over
time.

What once was a place to chat with people across the planet is now a platform
for commercialization of products and services. We have no issue with the
commercialization of the web. However, we are more aligned with products and
services that promote human communication and collaboration. Most of these
services don't require modern web technologies.

While we still intend on building web sites, our goal is to experiment with new
ways to encourage human communication and collaboration.

Another thing we have noticed is the ever-expanding number of features that get
added to a project over time. Without restraint, projects quickly expand until
they require a team to maintain them. We want to resist the urge to continuously
grow our projects. Relatively small, self-contained projects are what get us
excited about engineering.

## goals

- Promote human communication and collaboration
- Build a space for the smaller web
- Use modern tools with care
- Projects should to do one thing, well
- Foster a community of hackers who enjoy minimalism
- A single person can fully understand a project
