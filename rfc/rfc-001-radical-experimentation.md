We want to create and maintain services that we love to use. We also want to embody a mindset where we rapidly iterate on new ideas and kill ones that are not serving us.

Our mission is to make it easier than ever for developers to rapidly prototype on the web. We accomplish this by adhering to a set of design principles:

- We must use what we build
- Done is better than perfect
- Aggressively reduce user friction
- Share early and often
- Users don't know until they see it

Pruning is a critical part of radical experimentation. It's a weak will to ignore what is plainly obvious: no code is sacred.

This necessitates that we create **and** more importantly, destroy ideas as quickly as possible. When we see something that isn't working, we need to prune it. Radical experimentation requires us to think about new ideas from first principles, to fundamentally challenge the status quo, and to be a beacon for like-minded individuals to rally around. Radical experimentation is our stake in the ground: come join us.

Our primary directive is to build tools and services that we **need** to use.

With deep introspection, a curiosity for new ideas, a passion for code, and radical experimentation, we are building tools to accelerate developer productivity.
