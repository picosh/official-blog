We want to create and maintain services that we love to use. We also want to
embody a mindset where we rapidly iterate on new ideas and kill ones that are
not serving us.

If you didn't already read, we decided to
[shutdown lists.sh](/ann-012-lists-shutdown-notice). This is the first service
that we shared with the world and is also the first service we are shutting
down. Pruning is a critical part of radical experimentation. We cannot allow one
sour apple to spoil the bunch. We could have easily continued to maintain lists
for eternity, but that doesn't serve our mission. It's a weak will to ignore
what is plainly obvious: **no code is sacred at pico.sh.**

We recently adopted a new tagline: **hacker labs**. When we think about what
that means we think about radical experimentation. This necessitates that we
create **and** more importantly, destroy ideas as quickly as possible. When we
see something that isn't working, we need to prune it. Radical experimentation
requires us to think about new ideas from first principles, to fundamentally
challenge the status quo, and to be a beacon for like-minded individuals to
rally around. Radical experimentation is our stake in the ground: come join us.

Our primary directive is to build tools and services that we **need** to use.

With deep introspection, a curiosity for new ideas, radical experimentation, and
a passion for code, we are building something greater than what is available
today.
