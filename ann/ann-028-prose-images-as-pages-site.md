The reason for this change was mainly internal cleanup but as a result we are
automatically generating a [pages](https://pico.sh/pgs) site (`prose`) for
[prose](https://prose.sh) blog images. This setup has some benefits:

- Every user has a single "bucket" for static assets
- Images can be viewed, managed through a pages site

There's really only one caveat: if you change the `prose` site (e.g. upload or
delete images) it'll change what prose can access. Further, if you upload images
to it then you'll be able to reference them in your blog post.

In an effort to prevent a foot-gun, we are **not** allowing users to delete the
project itself.

Since prose is now "hosting" its images on pages, we have combined the storage
limits for the pico platform into a single "bucket." We are continuing to
experiment with how much storage we allow for users, both free and `pico+`.
Eventually we would like to be in a position where we don't have to limit
storage, but we aren't there yet. If the new storage limit is an issue for you,
please feel free to [message us](https://pico.sh/contact).
