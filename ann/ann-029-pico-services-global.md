Greetings!

We are excited to announce that pico is now multi-region!

This is a big deal for us. We have plenty of users across the globe and for some of our services, it's imperative we host them as close to users as possible.

We want to provide low-latency access to our services in an effort to provide the best service possible. With this announcement both [pgs.sh](https://pico.sh/pgs) and [tuns.sh](https://pico.sh/tuns) are hosted in the US and Germany, with aspirations to add more services and regions to the international list.

We use geographical-based DNS routing to figure out the best location to serve both services, so users don't have to choose a region, it's automatic.

Read our [regions doc](https://pico.sh/regions) to learn more about service locations.

We hope you all are as excited about this announcement, so please feel free to write to us with comments, feedback, and excitement.

We have more great things being developed but we will save that for a status update.

Cya!
