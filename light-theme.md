description: A new light theme that respects prefers-color-scheme
tags: [feature, announcement]
---

Greetings,

We wanted to let everyone know that we have added a new light theme to prose!

Don't worry, we didn't ditch the dark theme, prose respects the
[prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme)
property.

We considered putting a toggle on the website but most of the solutions we
thought about didn't really fit the vibe of prose. Namely, we don't want to use
javascript or cookies.

We figured this would be a happy medium for users.
