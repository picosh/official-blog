## philosophy

We grew up on the web; it's nostalgic. We've also seen how it's changed over
time.

What once was a place to chat and collaborate with people across the planet is
now a platform for the commercialization of products and services. At the seat
of the modern web is the browser. The modern browser is very much like an
operating system, both in terms of complexity and code size. Only massive
corporations can build and maintain it. Further, the web breeds platforms that
exploit your
[nucleus accumbens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens#Function) in
order to increase "engagement." We have no issue with the commercialization of
the web -- that's how useful services exist. However, we are more aligned with
products and services that promote human communication and collaboration in its
purest forms. Many of our services don't require a password, but still offer
many familiar features like content management.

While we still intend on building web sites, our goal is to experiment with new
ways to encourage human communication and collaboration.

Finally, we have noticed great projects that over time continue to expand their
scope until it buckles under its own weight. Without restraint, projects quickly
expand until they require a team to maintain them or the developers burn out and
get bored. We want to resist the urge to continuously grow our projects.
Relatively small, self-contained projects are what get us excited about
engineering.

## goals

- Promote human communication and collaboration
- Build a space for the smaller web
- Use modern tools with care
- Projects should to do one thing, well
- Foster a community of hackers who enjoy minimalism
- A single person can fully understand a project
