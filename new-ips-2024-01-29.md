title: new ips for our services

Hey everyone. We wanted to let everyone know that we just changed the IP
addresses for our services, so if you have a custom domain and a DNS that
**doesnt** support CNAME flatening, you will probably need to update your
`A records`.

Sorry for this inconvienence, but we are making some changes to our
infrastrcture, which included getting reserved IP addresses. So as an added
benefit our IPs should not change as much going forward.

# New IPv4s

- [prose.sh](https://prose.sh): 132.226.47.216
- [pgs.sh](https://pgs.sh): 129.158.37.104
- [pastes.sh](https://pastes.sh): 129.158.244.68

Let us know in IRC if you are having any other issues.
