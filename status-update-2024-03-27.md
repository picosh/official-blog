Things are going well at [pico.sh](https://pico.sh). We announced
[pgs.sh](https://pgs.sh) on
[hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39538335) and are excited
about the overall feedback.

As a result, we had more users trying our services out and generating a ton of
engagement.

Here's some quick stats as of today:

- 27 pico+ signups
- 2,664 pico users
- 7,987 blog posts
- 178 pgs sites
- 213 pastes
- 26 feeds

Since the pgs announcement we've been working hard at improving our services.
Here's a
[diff of all our changes](https://github.com/picosh/pico/compare/bb837ba2cdbb2f05cf28a1c24721cfe183f2753e..main)
(4,858 additions and 1,119 deletions) to our main pico repo.

Over the last few months we have been constantly updating our docs and plan to
keep that momentum going.

One of the more exciting things we have developed recently is an
[experimental UI](https://pico.sh/ui) built using
[Web Tunnels](https://pico.sh/tunnels). This UI will allow users to manage their
content, their account settings, and even view analytics on their blog and
sites. We are very eager to get feedback on the UI because we see a future where
this is the primary way users manage their content and account. I also recently
[published a video](https://youtu.be/pRLC7dzxZzc?si=gbv3dXwcjV2K572s) talking
about web tunnels and the new UI, lemme know what you think.

You might be wondering, what's next?

We have a couple high level goals:

- Produce more content talking about our services (docs, tutorials, guides,
  videos, etc.)
- Release analytics for blogs and pgs
- International support for pico+
- Improve pgs.sh and imgs.sh features
- Build a compute service to host databases and web services

That's it for now, cya!
