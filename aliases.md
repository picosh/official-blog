Hey!

It's been awhile since we've posted on the official blog. I wanted to let
everyone know that we are still actively working on pico services and just
recently deployed a feature that I've been wanting for awhile: aliases.

This was one of the features that I needed in order to move my
[Hugo blog](https://erock.io) to [prose.sh](https://prose.sh).

```

aliases:
  - /some-other/url/very-nice.html

```

This feature in particular enables people to migrate blogs to prose.

As you'll see, [erock.io](https://erock.io) has moved to prose successfully.
